# finviz

FinViz is an app I built to learn Plotly and Flask. The app allows users to analyze a stock of choice. Users search for a stock ticker of choice and the app returns metrics like Market Capitalization, PE Ratio, Current Ratio, and more. 

The application uses the Financial Modeling Prep API and SDK as its source for company data.
